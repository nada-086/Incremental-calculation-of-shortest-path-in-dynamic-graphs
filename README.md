**Project Description: Shortest Path Query Solver**

This repository contains an implementation for solving the shortest path problem on a dynamic graph efficiently. The problem entails finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph while minimizing the sum of the weights of its constituent edges. This problem is fundamental in graph theory and has practical applications in GPS navigation, computer network routing, search engines, and social networks.

The project task is to efficiently answer shortest path queries on a dynamic graph. Initially, a graph is provided, which can be processed and indexed as needed. Subsequently, a workload consisting of sequential operation batches is issued. Each operation can be a graph modification (insertion or removal of edges or nodes) or a query about the shortest path between two nodes.

The program must correctly answer all queries as if all operations were executed in the given order. The graphs are directed and unweighted, and input is provided via standard input and files, while output must be displayed on standard output and files. This implementation provides a solution for efficiently handling dynamic graph modifications and answering shortest path queries.
